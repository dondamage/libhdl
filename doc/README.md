This folder contains documentation, conventions and guidelines related to
and/or applied throughout the libHDL project.

Philosophy of the libHDL project:
Create a platform independent HDL library for versatile usage in basic and
more complex applications. The focus lies on providing modules and functions
to solve common design problems of HDL development (_not_ to provide
highly optimized solutions which are streamlined to specialiced applications).
