Install doxygen and add its executable to your path.
Optionally install graphviz to support the automated drawing of diagrams
and other graphics (and add its executable to your path).

Special doxygen comments start with '--!' and can be included into the source
code to enable doxygen documentation generation.
These special comments should be used sparingly and should not be heavily
interleaved into the flow of source code.
The recommended usage aims towards documentation of interfaces and naming
the purpose of certain design units, e.g. processes, without going into
obvious implementation details.

The following special commands of doxygen are used for code documentation:

\author
\authors
In file header: name of the author(s) of the file.

\brief
In file header: brief description of the design unit implemented in the file.
                This should be a very compact summary of the task a design unit carries
                out or the functionality it offers.
Before process|subprogram|block|component instantiation: brief description of the functionality or purpose of the following design unit.

\bug
In file header: notify the user about bugs and known issues. Each bug/issue is listed separately.
                If possible a way to avoid or work around the bug/issue should be suggested.

\copyright
In file header: state the copyright and licensing conditions that apply to the file.
                Should also contain contact information of the author or copyright holder.

\date
In file header: date at which the last modification occured. The file header in total should always
                be updated as soon as it becomes necessary.                

\details
In file header: 
Before process|subprogram|block|component instantiation: more detailed description of the implementation of the design unit. Limitations and basic design criterions can be elaborated.

\example:
In file header: a short example of the usage of the design unit.
Before subprogram: show an usage example and the expected results.

\file
In file header: add this command to enable doxygen documentation generation.
                Only the name of the file without file extension should be noted here.

\note
Anywhere: Add to point out non-obvious connections and/or interrelations.
          A note should add information and increase the understanding of code/text.
          Do not repeat yourself.

\param
Before subprograms: parameters to subprogram.
Before processes:

\post
Before subprograms: postcondition after calling subprogram.
Before processes: postcondition after the process has carried out its intended task.

\pre
Before subprograms: precondition before calling subprogram.
Before processes: precondition for a process to start its intended task.

\see
In file header: list of references useful for the understanding of the file.
                E.g. standards, RFCs, papers, book chapters, web links &cetera.

\todo
In file header: to remember tasks which must done later on but not right now.
In source code: a reminder for improvements and/or limitations of code segments or implementation choices.

\version
In file header: version of the file. Automagic incrementing preferable on commit.
                The format of the version should be specified up ahead.

\vhdlflow
Before process: Add in front of a process to create a flow diagram of the process.
                Works decently well, but diagrams tend to get too big for
                processes with normal complexity.

\warning
In file header: warn of common errors or wrong usage of the design unit.
In source code: Add within the code to prevent erroneous interpretation of code.
